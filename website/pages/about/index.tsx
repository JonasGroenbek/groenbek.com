            I have always been fascinated by computers. I had a long commute in
            high school since I had to travel cross country from Denmark to
            Sweden. While doing so, I often watched my classmate build an
            android application while on the train. He would often try to
            explain concepts to me, or I would develop ideas for the app. After
            multiple failed attempts to build one, I chose to study Computer
            Science and, later, Software Development.

            Since graduating with a Bachelorâ€™s in Software Development, I have
            played a vital role in building various systems with influences
            across the stack. I am most effective in building web-based
            products, particularly in TypeScript, where I am experienced in
            building client-side and server-side applications. I have worked
            with software development operations such as data migrations,
            service monitoring, automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, system
            infrastructure, and automated deployment strategies. More recently,
            I have had some responsibilities within management, where I have
            worked with business operations and managing other developers.
